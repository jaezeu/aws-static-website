Note that in this method, you would be only creating a S3 bucket with S3 static web hosting enabled. However, using this method you will not have access to more features which you can get from the Cloudfront -> S3 method (such as HTTPS with ACM, WAF, Caching etc.)

Therefore this code is just for reference purposes only.
